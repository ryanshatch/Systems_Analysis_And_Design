<h2>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</h2>   <!-- Question one -->

<p>The DriverPass project was initiated to address the high failure rates among individuals attempting the DMV driving test. The client, DriverPass, sought a comprehensive solution that combined online training, in-person lessons, and practical driving experience. The envisioned system would offer online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training, aiming to improve success rates for driving test takers. The goal was to create a user-friendly, secure platform that would allow customers, administrators, and employees to manage appointments, track progress, and access relevant resources efficiently.</p>
